I wrote this about a week ago.

Tonight is the first night I've Parked in a Wal-Mart Parking lot. Wal mart has a policy that allows RV 'S to spend the night. Tomorrow I will wake up about an hour Outside of Toronto.

As for today I Spent my Day in the Capital of CANADA

You Guessed it OTTOWA. While in Ottawa l

\* Played Soccer with Locals in the park

\* helped a Struggling market vendor with her canopy in the rain and got some free Delicious Strawberries and biked along the river that Divides Quebec (french speaking province) and Ontario.

Being in a predominantly English speaking place in again is definitely nice. I Thouroughly enjoyed my Time in both Montneal and in Tremblant. But having to Continuously ask people to speak in English got old fast. I just wished I had tried to learn more French before going

. Now I know that for the next Country that I end up in to make sure to have a grasp on the language so I can become a local.

l don't usually listen to the radio in my van (because it sounds like crap) but today I did and I heard someone discussing The Olympics. He mentioned how there is a new trend Called Slumtourism, which is where rich People go to the Poorest parts of other countries for the experience. What it is like. I found this concept interesting, and also realized that l would do the exact same thing, granted it would be because I'm actually poor but also because I really want to live a day in every ones life. Stay tuned for adventures in travel, permaculture, and finding jobs in other states to fund my journey.
