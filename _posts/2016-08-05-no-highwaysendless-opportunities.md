# No Highways=Endless opportunities

My theme of today was to avoid tolls and Highways. My reasoning for this was to see more than just guardrails and asphalt.

Turns out not taking highways was the best option. As I was passing through southern NH I found Mt Manadnok. I started climbing up at 7:00am and got to the top in an hour, did some yoga at the peak then descended. All in all this detour took me 2.5-3 hours, cost $5, and the experience was priceless.

I was also able to take a shower afterwards and refill my water supply.

After that, I kept driving (off highways) and stumbled upon a farm stand. The vegetables that were out were summer squash, cucumbers and tomatoes, three things I coincidentally was in full supply of. The woman who ran the farm stand came out, and I asked her if she had any greens, she walked me to her garden and starting pulling up kale, swiss chard, arugala, and some delicious flower. She showed me her goats and I got to hold a baby goat for the first time(none of this happens on highways).

After touring her homestead she wanted to settle the money, she asked me for 50Â¢ for the whole bag of goodness. I gave her a dollar and a smile, she then proceeded to get me some dill goat cheese and said it's on the house. (She really liked my van I think)

The lunch I made with this food was so good. Local foods turned into a heavenly dish.
