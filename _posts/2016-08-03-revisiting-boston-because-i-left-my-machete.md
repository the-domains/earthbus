# Revisiting Boston because I left my Machete

That's right? I'm very forgetful, so I leave things everywhere, gonna work on that. I also need to work on making plans for the journey.

One thing I've found helpful so far is to google free food locations and ask them if they need a volunteer, I'm betting I can score my own free meals and be of help while traveling. Maybe even land a job. I'm going to be helping at slow food Vermont tomorrow.

Heading to Vermont tonight, hopefully volunteer at a free food event, then head to Montreal to meet up with friends.

Work I did today:

-set up slackline

-cooked meals for three

-set up 30 gallon water barrel

-Drove through awesome tunnel

As always hit me up if im in your area and you have cool volunteer opportunities, delicious meals that need to be cooked or, adventure that awaits.
