# Revisiting Boston because I left my Machete

That's right? I'm very forgetful, so I leave things everywhere, gonna work on that. I also need to work on making plans for the journey.

One thing I've found helpful so far is to google free food locations and ask them if they need a volunteer, I'm betting I can score my own free meals and be of help while traveling. Maybe even land a job. I'm going to be helping at slow food Vermont tomorrow.

Heading to Vermont tonight, hopefully volunteer at a free food event, then head to Montreal to meet up with friends.

Work I did today:
