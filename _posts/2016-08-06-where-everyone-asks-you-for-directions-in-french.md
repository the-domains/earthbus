Where Everyone Asks You for Directions in French

Montreal

I've had a good experience in Montreal, within the first 20 minutes I found a slackliners community(they said on Sunday they are rigging a 300ft long line). I also met up with some old friends from boston. Feels like I've been gone forever already and it's only been a few days on the road.

I need to go find a library and practice some French at least enough to say I don't speak French, English please.
